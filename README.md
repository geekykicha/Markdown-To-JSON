# Markdown-To-JSON
A Markdown to JSON Converter in JavaScript is a program that parses a Markdown file and converts it into a structured JSON format. The JSON format can represent the contents of the Markdown, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and other elements, making it easier to manipulate and process programmatically.

Here’s a simple outline of how the program works:

1 Input: The user provides a Markdown string or file.
2 Parse Markdown: The program processes the Markdown text using a Markdown parser library like marked or markdown-it.
3 Convert to JSON: The parsed Markdown structure is transformed into a JSON object, where each Markdown element (e.g., heading, list item) is a key-value pair.
4 Output: The resulting JSON object is returned, allowing the data to be accessed programmatically.
